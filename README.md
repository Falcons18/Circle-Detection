# Circle-Detection
Circle Detection using OpenCV in Python.

The 2018 SAE Aeromodelling Advanced Class rules requires a RC plane to carry static payload and drop dynamic payload in the given target zone. Therefore, in order to help the payload specialist to drop the payloads accurately within the drop zones, a circle detection system has been integrated in our aircraft. It involves image processing and computer vision principles applied on the FPV received at the ground station. 

The tools used for this purpose were

•	An open source software, OpenCV, used for image processing and computer vision applications. The software works on both C++ and Python programming languages. Python was chosen over C++ because it is simple and easy to understand as compared to C++.

•	NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
It was used to do operations on frames of the FPV received, like applying filters and contour detection.
